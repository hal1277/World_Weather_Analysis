# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this challenge was to create the backend for a PlanMyTrip app to allow customers to search for vacations based on their preferred weather.  Weather data was collected using the Openweather API and Python coding was written using Jupyter Notebook.  An input question was crated to allow users to enter their preferred tempearate range and from this using the Goole Maps API data was collected on which cities met this criteria.  A search of hotels nearby was then performed also using data from the Google Maps API.  A potential itinerary was then created between 4 cities in the same country using the Goole Maps Directions API.  Finally a map with markers showing the city, hotel, and weather was created for the cities in the itinerary.
